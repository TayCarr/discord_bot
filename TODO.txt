make inventory display nicer

way to sell inventory !sell

way to gamble coins !gamble 

OR a few different things like !slot umm !rolldice idk diff gamble games

!bang or something shoots a random person and they drop x coins maybe you shoot yourself

add to profile command to follow with a users name and view their profile??

for the ummm stats command since it is steams player id not the username i COULD have a way to save the id to the discord user and then after they have linked it they can just use their discord name
